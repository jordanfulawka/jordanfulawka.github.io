      <p>
          As the first half of my third placement at Kenna has come to a close, 
          in this report I will be going in-depth about my experience on the application development team. 
          I hope to explain not only my responsibilities during this term, but my growth at Kenna 
          and what has changed during this term compared to my last. I’d like to give an overview of 
          my contributions and the impact I had on both my team and others, and provide examples of the 
          outcomes of my efforts. Additionally I’d like to illustrate how the skills and knowledge 
          I’ve acquired there will benefit me in future endeavours, whether in an academic setting or future employment.

      Kenna has many teams that all pertain to different parts of computer science. 
      The team that I am in, which is application development, focuses on 
      building and maintaining web applications and other tools used by our clients. 
      Our work involves a mix of frontend and backend development and touches on 
      everything from UI/UX design to server-side logic. I’ve had the opportunity 
      to contribute to several projects, gaining hands-on experience with web technologies 
      and collaborative development workflows. In my previous term, I also helped out with 
      data-related requests when needed, which gave me useful exposure to how different systems 
      at Kenna interact and was knowledge that has been very beneficial to me this term. 
      I’m excited to continue growing on the application development team during my next co-op term.

      Some interesting facts about Kenna is that they have worked with many 
      brands in many different industries since starting in 1985, 
      when under the name "AppliCan Marketing". Some of these brands 
      are Mars, Zeneca, Colgate, Rogers, Coca Cola, Molson, and McCormicks. 
      They initially focused on sales reporting and store merchandising, 
      before switching to a more digital approach of marketing just before the year 2000.

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Here are my goals for this term: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve my React skills</li>
      <li>Develop a better understanding of how front and back-end systems interact in a full stack application</li>
      <li>Enhance my ability to work effectively in a development team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img src="react.js.png" alt="react logo" id="react" />
      My first goal was to develop my ability to build interactive interfaces 
      by gaining hands-on experience with React. React was something that was 
      somewhat new to me this term, as I have had minimal experience with it 
      in previous classes, but overall I would say I was a beginner. 
      Since I was using it quite extensively every day as part of my responsibilities, 
      I made it my goal to become proficient in it and be able to build and update 
      components quickly and effectively. I knew that improving my React skills 
      would help me contribute more meaningfully to the team’s projects, and also 
      would improve my employability as it’s a valuable and widely used technology 
      in the industry. Since the position ideally assumes a solid prior understanding 
      of React, I was at a bit of a disadvantage at the start, and there weren’t many 
      onboarding resources specific to the codebase, so I had to learn React largely 
      on my own as I went. I did this by reading documentation, watching tutorials, 
      and experimenting directly in the codebase. After a few weeks, things began to 
      make more sense, and I found myself working more independently and not needing the 
      resources I once relied on. That said, I continued to ask questions and learn from 
      my teammates throughout the term, they were always helpful and offered great advice 
      on best practices. I felt I had achieved my goal once I was able to take on tasks 
      involving React features with little to no assistance and contribute to key parts 
      of our application. My team was even able to rely on me to finish features that had 
      a tight deadline, which felt great and made me actually feel like an integral part 
      of the team. Overall, I really enjoyed working with React and I’m glad I had the 
      opportunity to gain hands-on experience with it.

    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="full_stack.jpg" alt="full-stack" id="full-stack" />
      Another goal I had this term was to develop a clear understanding of how 
      front-end and back-end systems interact by working on full stack features, 
      from implementing UI components to integrating APIs and handling database 
      operations. To work towards this, I actively took on tasks that involved 
      both sides of the stack, using React on the front-end and Node.js on the 
      back-end. I made an effort to study how the different parts of the 
      application connect, including routes, services, and controllers, as 
      well as how APIs are designed and how database queries are structured. 
      This gave me a much deeper appreciation for the full workflow of a feature 
      and the reasoning behind certain design decisions. My goal was to be able 
      to implement a complete feature from start to finish with minimal guidance, 
      and to clearly explain how data moves through the system. By the end of 
      the term, I was able to do exactly that, taking ownership of a small 
      feature that required updates across the front-end, API, and database 
      layers. Specifically, the feature involved uploading an excel file on 
      the front-end of a website, and then having this excel file actually be 
      inserted into SQL tables in the back-end. I worked on this feature 
      completely alone and I would consider it a big success as it worked 
      well and was a core feature of the project I was working on. This experience 
      helped me solidify my understanding of full-stack development, and I 
      feel much more confident in my navigating and contributing to all parts 
      of a web application.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="collaboration.png" alt="collaboration" id="collaboration" />
      My final goal I set for this term was to enhance my ability to 
      work effectively in a development team by improving my communication, 
      task coordination, and participation in the team’s workflow. To achieve this,
       I made a point of contributing regularly in our weekly team meetings, asking 
       clarifying questions when needed, and actively collaborating with teammates 
       whenever possible. I also focused on improving my technical communication by 
       practicing clear documentation in my code and following Git best practices, 
       such as writing meaningful commit messages and managing branches properly. 
       These habits helped me stay organized and made it easier for others to understand 
       and work with my contributions. My measure of success for this goal was to receive 
       positive feedback on my collaboration skills and to avoid creating workflow blockers 
       for the team, which was met during my end-of-term check-in with my manager where 
       he complimented my skills in working with others. By the end of the term, I felt 
       much more confident in how I communicated and coordinated with others, and I 
       was able to contribute to the team’s progress without causing delays. Overall, 
       I found that putting effort into teamwork not only helped the project run 
       more smoothly, but also made the experience more enjoyable and rewarding.

    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like I have gotten as close as I can to completing these goals 
      during my work term. This placement at Kenna has really helped me 
      gain confidence in my skills and show me I have what it takes to work 
      as a developer. I look forward to seeing how I can apply what 
      I’ve learnt here to other endeavours in my life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="role">My Role at Kenna</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="development.png" alt="" id="development" />
      My job title at Kenna for this term was an Application Developer. 
      My primary responsibility was working on internal and client-facing 
      web applications using JavaScript and React. These applications 
      provide a wide range of services to our clients, from data entry 
      and reporting tools, to interfaces for managing campaigns and 
      contests. I contributed to building new features from the ground 
      up, improving existing components, and ensuring that our 
      applications were both functional and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of my work also involved interacting with the backend, 
      particularly when implementing full-stack features. This 
      meant working with Node.js, writing and updating API routes, 
      and interacting with the database to retrieve, insert, or manipulate 
      data as needed. I gained experience with SQL queries and backend 
      logic that ensured the front-end displayed accurate and up-to-date information.

    </p>
    <p>
      Another key part of my role was addressing issues that 
      arose during QA testing. I was responsible for reproducing bugs, 
      finding the root cause, and implementing fixes in both the front-end 
      and back-end code. This process helped reinforce my understanding 
      of the entire application stack and improve my debugging skills significantly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to project work, I was able to see the workflow of 
      an application from the early planning stages to the final implementation. 
      I learnt how to write clean, maintainable code, learn to collaborate 
      with other developers, and follow Git best practices like proper commit 
      messages and branch management. Overall this role gave me the opportunity 
      to contribute to real-world applications used by both clients and internal 
      users, while deepening my technical skill across both front-end and back-end 
      development.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I hope this report has shed some light on my experiences 
      with Kenna and the impact they have had on me both personally 
      and professionally during my short time here. I'd like to 
      quickly review the most important parts of this report:
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenna is a marketing solutions company that works primarily 
      with BASF to deliver a wide variety of services to help improve 
      both the internal workings of the company, as well as the external 
      customer experience. I work on the development team, where I work 
      on the reports we show to stakeholders and ensure they run 
      correctly and show accurate information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goals I set out during this term were to develop my 
      abilities with React, gain a clear understanding of the 
      interaction between the front-end and back-end of a full stack 
      application, and learn how to better work in a development team. 
      I believe I have made big steps towards these goals and have no 
      doubt will continue to improve as I embark on the latter half of 
      this co-op and future academic and professional pursuits. This work 
      term has been a big success so far and I’m grateful I’ve had the 
      opportunity to learn all of these new things.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
    <h2 id="acknowledge">Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>
      I’d like to give acknowledgement to my manager Nicholas. Nicholas 
      has given me so much freedom in what I want to work on and has given 
      me countless opportunities to explore things that I am interested in. 
      I’m very lucky to have him as my manager and is a big reason why this 
      co-op term has been so enjoyable.
