      <p>
        As my second placement at Kenna has come to a close, in this report I
        will be going in-depth about my experience on the development team. I
        hope to explain not only my responsibilities during this term, but my
        growth at Kenna and what has changed during this term compared to my
        last. I’d like to give an overview of my contributions and the impact I
        had on both my team and others, and provide examples of the outcomes of
        my efforts. Additionally I’d like to illustrate how the skills and
        knowledge I’ve acquired there will benefit me in future endeavours,
        whether in an academic setting or future employment.

    <h2 id="info">Information about Kenna</h2>
    <img src="basf.jpeg" alt="basf logo" id="basf" />
    <p>
      Kenna is a dynamic marketing solutions company known for its extensive
      collaboration with BASF, a prominent player in the agricultural industry.
      However, Kenna's influence extends far beyond this partnership,
      encompassing a broad spectrum of services. Some of the things they offer
      include insights and analytics, data management, and cultivating a strong
      and vibrant brand experience. Their core mission is to craft a unified and
      streamlined experience that is tailored specifically for each of their
      clientele to meet their exact needs. A major focal point for Kenna lies in
      building loyal customer relationships, which is supported by their motto,
      "customer first thinking." As such a diverse organization, Kenna thrives
      on its ability to cater to a wide range of needs across several
      industries.

      Kenna has many teams that all pertain to different parts of computer
      science. The team that I am in, which is BI development, focuses on things
      like databases, SQL, and data visualization. I also frequently helped out
      with data requests while my manager was away, which gave really good
      practice getting more familiar with the tables and processes at Kenna.
      There is also an application development team, where they work on
      developing any other tools that any clients may require. This is the team
      I have been invited to join during my next co-op term, and I am really
      looking forward to it.
    </p>

      Some interesting facts about Kenna is that they have worked with many
      brands in many different industries since starting in 1985, when under the
      name "AppliCan Marketing". Some of these brands are Mars, Zeneca, Colgate,
      Rogers, Coca Cola, Molson, and McCormicks. They initially focused on sales
      reporting and store merchandising, before switching to a more digital
      approach of marketing just before the year 2000.

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My goals for this term are heavily built on those of last term. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reach an intermediate level in Tableau</li>
      <li>Reach an advanced level in SQL</li>
      <li>Improve time management skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img src="sql2.png" alt="sql logo" id="sql" />
      Tableau was something that was completely new to me this term, and I was
      using it extensively everyday when performing my duties. As such, I made
      it my goal to become very proficient in it and be able to develop reports
      as quickly and efficiently as possible. I knew this would allow me to not
      only perform better at my job, but would also be very valuable to have in
      the future as Tableau is widely used and an in-demand skill. Since
      technically the position requires you to already know Tableau, I was at a
      bit of a disadvantage at the start as there were hardly any training
      materials to reference, so I had to learn it almost completely on my own.
      I did this by watching videos and searching things up as I worked with the
      software. Eventually things started to click and I improved quickly and
      after around a month I could do most things by myself. But, even by the
      end of my term I was still occasionally asking the others on my team
      questions about things. They were always happy to help and I was
      constantly learning new processes or better ways to do things. I felt that
      I had reached this goal when I was able to complete my day to day tasks
      without much help at all and could manage completing several reports in a
      single day. Overall I enjoyed working with Tableau and am glad I had the
      opportunity to learn it.

      Another goal I had for this term was to reach an advanced level in SQL.
      Since I already had 8 months worth of SQL experience prior to this term, I
      knew this would be possible and wanted to see how far I could push myself.
      SQL was a large part of my day to day activities so I had a lot of time to
      practice it. Although Kenna offers a lot of resources for learning SQL, I
      had already been through them last term and they weren’t enough to get me
      to the level I wanted to be at. To reach this goal I primarily completed
      online courses and watched videos about advanced concepts, but also often
      would ask someone else on the team for help as I felt it was easiest to
      learn when a concept was being explained to me and I was able to ask for
      clarification in real time. By the end of my term I was able to
      confidently write complex scripts from scratch with very little to no
      errors and was able to be relied on to complete data requests on my own,
      which felt great as I knew my team trusted me and could rely on me to get
      things done correctly. Now I have a full year of SQL experience and would
      consider myself at an advanced level. I have really enjoyed working with
      SQL and know this skill will be useful in the future, especially now that
      I have taken an interest in data science.

      My final goal was to improve my time management skills. This term I knew I
      would have a lot of work as the sole co-op on my team and I felt it would
      be beneficial to learn how to properly chunk and allocate my time to
      specific tasks. For the first couple of weeks I didn’t spend much time on
      this goal as I was just getting a feel for how long things generally took
      me, and once I was able to gauge this I could set achievable goals for
      each day. I created a structured schedule and allocated specific amounts
      of time to each task which helped me stay organized and made it easy to
      prioritize. In turn I never felt overwhelmed during my term and often had
      to ask for more work as I would finish early. I was able to stay
      productive and never fell behind on any deadlines. This made it easier to
      focus on specific tasks and minimized distractions, and also kept my
      stress level very low. This really helped me find out what kind of
      schedule works for me as everyone prefers to manage their time differently
      and I was lucky enough to have found the optimal strategy. This can be
      applied to all areas of my life and in general is a great skill to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like I have gotten as close as I can to completing these goals
      during my work term. This placement at Kenna has really helped me gain
      confidence in my skills and show me I have what it takes to work as a
      developer. I look forward to seeing how I can apply what I’ve learnt here
      to other endeavours in my life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="role">My Role at Kenna</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="report2.jpeg" alt="" id="report" />
      My job title at Kenna for this term was a BI/SQL developer. I had a couple
      duties, but my main one was dealing with the AgConnect reports. The
      reports hosted on the AgConnect site show information to clients or
      stakeholders regarding sales data, campaigns, contests or other important
      data. These reports are made using Tableau and it was my responsibility to
      roll these reports over to the next year or sometimes create new ones from
      scratch. I was also called on to fix any bugs to existing reports. This
      process also involved working in the backend SQL procedures to ensure that
      we had correct and up to date data for the reports to pull from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another responsibility of mine was to work on data requests. Under normal
      circumstances I don’t think this is something usually allocated to my
      position but due to my manager being on vacation for several weeks
      throughout my term, the requests were assigned to me. These requests come
      from a stakeholder asking for some sort of data that is not readily
      available on our reports, and it is my job to pull this data from the
      backend. I was already fairly familiar with this task as during my last
      role on the data reporting team, I was incharge of QAing the data whereas
      now I am the one pulling it and then sending it to be QA’d. This was a
      task I really enjoyed and was by far the most difficult thing I have done
      so far as these requests are usually obscure and more difficult to query
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final job I was given was called a “dev review” and consisted of me
      being assigned old reports and going through their stored procedure and
      Tableau workbooks to help speed them up and remove any old code or data
      sources. This was something I really enjoyed doing as it gave me a chance
      to look through things I wouldn’t have seen otherwise, and overall gain a
      better understanding as to how things worked at Kenna. It was also another
      opportunity to solidify my Tableau and SQL understanding.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I hope this report has shed some light on my experiences with Kenna and
      the impact they have had on me both personally and professionally during
      my short time here. I'd like to quickly review the most important parts of
      this report:
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenna is a marketing solutions company that works primarily with BASF to
      deliver a wide variety of services to help improve both the internal
      workings of the company, as well as the external customer experience. I
      work on the development team, where I work on the reports we show to
      stakeholders and ensure they run correctly and show accurate information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goals I set out during this term at Kenna were to reach an
      intermediate Tableau level, an advanced SQL level, and to improve my time
      management skills. All three of which I believe to have made big steps
      towards and have no doubt will continue to improve as I embark on the rest
      of my future co-ops and academic pursuits. This work term has been a big
      success and I’m very grateful I had the opportunity to learn all of these
      new things.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
    <h2 id="acknowledge">Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to give acknowledgement to my manager Jeremie. Not only did
      Jeremie take a chance on me and offer me this position during my last
      co-op, but also vouched for me and got me another job offer for the
      application development team next term. I’m very lucky to have had Jeremie
      as a manager and owe a lot of my co-op success to him.
