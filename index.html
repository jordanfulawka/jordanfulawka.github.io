        As the second half of my third placement at Kenna has come to a close,
        in this report I will be going in-depth about my experience on the
        application development team. I hope to explain not only my
        responsibilities during this term, but my growth at Kenna and what has
        changed during this term compared to my last. I’d like to give an
        overview of my contributions and the impact I had on both my team and
        others, and provide examples of the outcomes of my efforts. Additionally
        I’d like to illustrate how the skills and knowledge I’ve acquired there
        will benefit me in future endeavours, whether in an academic setting or
        future employment.

      Kenna has many teams that all pertain to different parts of computer
      science. The team that I am in, which is application development, focuses
      on building and maintaining web applications and other tools used by our
      clients. Our work involves a mix of frontend and backend development and
      touches on everything from UI/UX design to server-side logic. I’ve had the
      opportunity to contribute to several projects, gaining hands-on experience
      with web technologies and collaborative development workflows. In my
      previous term, I also helped out with data-related requests when needed,
      which gave me useful exposure to how different systems at Kenna interact
      and was knowledge that has been very beneficial to me this term. I’m
      excited to continue growing on the application development team during my
      next co-op term.

      Some interesting facts about Kenna is that they have worked with many
      brands in many different industries since starting in 1985, when under the
      name "AppliCan Marketing". Some of these brands are Mars, Zeneca, Colgate,
      Rogers, Coca Cola, Molson, and McCormicks. They initially focused on sales
      reporting and store merchandising, before switching to a more digital
      approach of marketing just before the year 2000.

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
    <p>Here are my goals for this term:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn a new skill</li>
      <li>Improve Code Quality through Testing and Best Practices</li>
      <li>Gain exposure to system design and scalability concepts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img src="Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-Logo.png" alt="aws logo" id="aws" />
      One of my goals this term was to learn and apply a new technology that I
      hadn’t used before. I was able to achieve this by working with AWS
      CloudFormation and Lambda functions in my projects. At the start, I was
      very unfamiliar with these tools, and setting up the initial template felt
      challenging. To get up to speed, I spent time reading documentation,
      watching tutorials, and asking questions to my manager, which helped me
      understand how the pieces fit together. Over time, I became comfortable
      using CloudFormation to set up infrastructure and gained a solid
      understanding of how Lambda functions are used in event-driven workflows.
      By the end of the term, I was not only able to contribute to my team by
      deploying infrastructure with CloudFormation, but I also felt confident
      explaining how these tools worked and how they supported our project
      needs. This experience gave me more confidence working with cloud
      technologies and showed me the value of picking up new tools to directly
      support real-world tasks. Looking ahead, I’d like to continue building on
      this foundation and explore more advanced use cases in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="vitest.png" alt="vitest" id="vitest" />
      Another goal I set for myself this term was to improve code quality
      through testing and best practices. I worked toward this by learning and
      applying the testing frameworks used by the team and writing automated
      tests for my own features. This was a natural progression from my focus
      last term on building features, as it allowed me to ensure the features I
      built were both reliable and maintainable. Writing tests pushed me to
      think more critically about edge cases, potential bugs, and the long-term
      stability of the code. In addition, participating in code reviews gave me
      the chance to learn from teammates and receive valuable feedback on my own
      contributions. Over time, I noticed that I was more confident in the
      quality of my work and that my pull requests reflected stronger test
      coverage and cleaner code. Overall, this goal helped me strengthen my
      development workflow and develop habits that will continue to be valuable
      in future projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="ecs.png" alt="ecs" id="ecs" />
      My final goal this term was to gain exposure to system design and
      scalability concepts. I wanted to move beyond just building features and
      start developing a better understanding of how applications are deployed,
      scaled, and maintained in production environments. To do this, I observed
      how my team approached architectural decisions and studied AWS services
      such as Elastic Container Service, which gave me valuable insight into how
      containerized workloads are managed at scale. I also learned more about
      how infrastructure choices, like load balancing and database optimization,
      directly impact performance and reliability. While I wasn’t directly
      responsible for making system-level decisions, I was able to contribute to
      discussions and better understand how the features I worked on fit into
      the larger architecture. This experience gave me a stronger appreciation
      of how software development ties into long-term system reliability and
      growth, and it has motivated me to continue building my knowledge in
      system design going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like I have gotten as close as I can to completing these goals
      during my work term. This placement at Kenna has really helped me gain
      confidence in my skills and show me I have what it takes to work as a
      developer. I look forward to seeing how I can apply what I’ve learnt here
      to other endeavours in my life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="role">My Role at Kenna</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="development.png" alt="" id="development" />
      My job title at Kenna for this term was an Application Developer. My
      primary responsibility was working on internal and client-facing web
      applications using JavaScript and React. These applications provide a wide
      range of services to our clients, from data entry and reporting tools, to
      interfaces for managing campaigns and contests. I contributed to building
      new features from the ground up, improving existing components, and
      ensuring that our applications were both functional and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of my work also involved interacting with the backend, particularly
      when implementing full-stack features. This meant working with Node.js,
      writing and updating API routes, and interacting with the database to
      retrieve, insert, or manipulate data as needed. I gained experience with
      SQL queries and backend logic that ensured the front-end displayed
      accurate and up-to-date information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another key part of my role was addressing issues that arose during QA
      testing. I was responsible for reproducing bugs, finding the root cause,
      and implementing fixes in both the front-end and back-end code. This
      process helped reinforce my understanding of the entire application stack
      and improve my debugging skills significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to project work, I was able to see the workflow of an
      application from the early planning stages to the final implementation. I
      learnt how to write clean, maintainable code, learn to collaborate with
      other developers, and follow Git best practices like proper commit
      messages and branch management. Overall this role gave me the opportunity
      to contribute to real-world applications used by both clients and internal
      users, while deepening my technical skill across both front-end and
      back-end development.
    </p>
